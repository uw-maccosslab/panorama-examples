## panorama-examples

In this repository you will find code examples for working with data stored on a Panorama Server. 

Panorama is a freely-available, open-source repository server application for targeted mass spectrometry assays that integrates into a [Skyline](https://skyline.gs.washington.edu/labkey/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view?) mass spec workflow.  It has been implemented as a module within LabKey Server, an open-source bioinformatics data management platform with extensive support for proteomics and small molecule data and a security model rich enough to support clinical studies.

The MacCoss Lab at the University of Washington hosts a public Panorama Server at https://panoramaweb.org.
